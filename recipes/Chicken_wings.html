    <p>
        Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the marinade:</strong> Whisk water, soy sauce, sugar, pineapple juice, 
                vegetable oil, garlic, and ginger together in a large glass or ceramic bowl until the sugar has dissolved. 
                Add chicken wings and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator 
                for at least 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease baking dishes and set them aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the chicken wings:</strong> Remove chicken wings from the marinade; 
                shake off excess and place them into the prepared baking dishes. Discard the remaining marinade.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake the chicken wings:</strong> Bake the chicken wings in the preheated oven until cooked through and 
                the glaze is evenly browned, about 1 hour. Use an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center to ensure 
                the chicken reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
